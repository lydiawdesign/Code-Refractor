GIVEN a webpage meets accessibility standards
- updated teh html lang to "en-US" to match accessiblity standards

WHEN I view the source code
THEN I find semantic HTML elements 

- added semantic elements like nav, section, aside, and footer rather than keeping everything div

WHEN I view the structure of the HTML elements
THEN I find that the elements follow a logical structure independent of styling and positioning

- reordered css page to match structure of HTML chronologically.

WHEN I view the image elements
THEN I find accessible alt attributes

- added alt text to each of the images displayed on the page and added aria-label to hero so that the background image will be recognized by the screen reader

WHEN I view the heading attributes
THEN they fall in sequential order

- changed the footer header to h4 rather than h4 to match the sequential order

WHEN I view the title element
THEN I find a concise, descriptive title

- updated the title to be more descriptive (to 'Horiseon Homepage')
